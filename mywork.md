With a deep understanding of cloud resources I drive automation, focusing on end-to-end deployments of microservices, serverless offerings like lambda and dynamodb, distributed data management using Kafka, and observability tools like Prometheus, Grafana and elastic search. 

Because of my work, I have received accolades and recognition and in my recent most projects I have gained experience in performing continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tasks and automating infrastructure using terraform and Cloud formation. I also have programming experience in Java, typescript and Python.

Furthermore, I have undergone professional trainings to imbibe good level of understanding for my niche and I am a recognized Associate certified from tech-giants like Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Oracle.

I started my career as a java developer. I was very good at the details of the development kit specifications. Through the years, I became curious about how applications were bundled, deployed and hosted. This led me to my next role. I began learning containerization, building pipelines and exploring AWS cloud. As soon as I began immersing myself into cloud devops, I felt that I could build automations, create infrastructure and deploy applications.

I'm currently working as a cloud engineer who fosters design and deployment of scalable applications. I help companies build resilient architectures and enhance the availability of workloads primarily using AWS and Azure as cloud providers.

As next leap in my career, I look for roles that would utilize my knowledge and expertise, hence allowing me grow as a Cloud Architect.
